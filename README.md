- Board is printed after every turn
- Turn-based logic with alternating symbols ('X' and 'O')
- Victory detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections

### Option 1: Compile manually
```bash
gcc main.c -o connect_four
./connect_four
```

### Option 2: Use NetBeans
- Open the project in NetBeans

## ðŸŽ¯ Game Controls

- Players are prompted to enter their name
